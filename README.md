# Wtf is this?

This is a collection of scripts I wrote for my own use. They are not meant to be used by anyone else, but if you find them useful, feel free to use them lol. Some of them are just for fun, some are for work, and some are just random things I thought would be cool to make and some of them might be stolen from someone, but I don't remember where I got them from. If you see something that is yours, please let me know and I will give you credit.
